### Centaur

It is a simple chatting app for the web for personal threads between people. The only way
to start chatting with somebody is to share a unique link with them which would connect you
with them instantly!

Cool, right?

Thanks [@BenForture](https://github.com/xbenjii) for providing the docker container for a live version! <3
